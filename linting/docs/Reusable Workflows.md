# Reusable Workflows Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide focuses on implementing caller workflows in CAMARA API repositories that utilize reusable liniting workflows from the `tooling` repository. 
For comprehensive information about reusable workflows, refer to the official GitHub documentation: [Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows).


## `tooling` Repository Structure

All files needed for implementation are stored in `tooling` repository.
```
tooling/
├── .github/workflows/          # Standard GitHub workflows location
├── linting/
│   ├── workflows/              # Caller workflows that use reusable workflows
│   ├── config/                 # Configuration files for linting tools
│   └── docs/                   # Documentation for linting  workflows
└── ...                         # other tools

```

### Reusable Workflows in `tooling` Repository

Reusable workflows are stored in the `tooling` repository under `.github/workflows/`.

Currenly definded workflows:

- **pr_validation.yml** - workflow to check PR related to API definition (OpenaAPI specification, Gherkin test definitions) using Megalinter
[Megalinter](https://megalinter.io) is a comprehensive linting tool designed to analyze and improve code quality across multiple programming languages and file types.
Megalinter combines dozens of popular linters into a single tool, allowing to check code quality, formatting, security issues, and best practices across entire repository.
Additional checks can be performed for Relase PRs (tbd).

- **spectral-oas.yml** - workflow to manually trigger [Spectral](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral) linter for OpenAPI with CAMARA ruleset.
Manual run of this workflow produces more detailed output compared to results presented by Megalinter.

### Workflow configuration files in `linting` folder

Configuration files in `/linting/config/`.




### Caller Workflows in `linting` folder
Caller workflows are stored in `/linting/workflows/`.

Currenly definded workflows:
- **pr_validation_caller.yml** - caller for PR validation workflow
- **spectral-oas-caller.yml** - caller for Spectral linter with CAMARA ruleset
