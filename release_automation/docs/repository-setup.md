# Repository Setup for Release Automation

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-17

## Overview

API repositories that adopt the CAMARA release automation need specific repository-level configuration. The workflow manages its own labels and concurrency, but cannot self-configure branch protection, CODEOWNERS entries, or install the caller workflow.

This document defines the required configuration for each API repository. It serves as:
- **Setup guide** for repository administrators onboarding new or existing repos
- **Verification reference** for test repo setup (WS9 testing phase)
- **Input specification** for the onboarding campaign and admin tooling

### What the workflow manages internally

| Item | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| 6 labels | Auto-created on first use (`release-issue` + 5 state labels) |
| Concurrency | `concurrency:` block in reusable workflow (one run per repo) |
| Permissions | `permissions:` block in caller workflow |

### What needs external configuration

| Item | Purpose | Section |
|------|---------|---------|
| Repository ruleset | Branch protection for snapshot branches | [Ruleset](#repository-ruleset) |
| CODEOWNERS file | Codeowner assignment for `/publish-release` authorization | [CODEOWNERS](#codeowners-requirements) |
| Caller workflow file | Entry point that connects the repo to the automation | [Caller Workflow](#caller-workflow) |
| `release-plan.yaml` | Release configuration (target tag, type, APIs) | [Required Files](#required-files) |
| README delimiters | Release Information section markers | [Required Files](#required-files) |
| CHANGELOG structure | Directory layout for per-cycle changelog files | [CHANGELOG Structure](#changelog-structure) |

## Repository Ruleset

One ruleset protects the `release-snapshot/**` branches that the release automation creates and manages. It combines branch protection rules (restrict creation, updates, deletion, force pushes) with PR review requirements (2 approvals, code owner review, RM team approval).

The `camara-release-automation` GitHub App is the bypass actor, allowing the workflow to create, push to, and delete snapshot branches while humans are fully governed by the PR + review gates.

No ruleset is needed for `release-review/**` branches — codeowners push review fixes directly to these branches, and the workflow handles creation and cleanup.

### Snapshot Branch Protection

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | `release-snapshot-protection` |
| **Enforcement** | Active |
| **Target** | Include branches matching: `release-snapshot/**` |
| **Bypass actors** | `camara-release-automation` GitHub App (always) |

**Branch protection rules:**
- Restrict creations — only bypass actors may create snapshot branches
- Restrict updates — only bypass actors may push
- Restrict deletions — only bypass actors may delete
- Block force pushes

**PR review rules:**
- Require a pull request before merging
- Required approvals: 2 (enforces four-eyes review even if a person is in both codeowner and RM reviewer teams)
- Require review from Code Owners
- Dismiss stale reviews on new pushes
- Required reviewers: `release-management_reviewers` team (1 approval, all files)

The dual review gate ensures both API codeowners and Release Management reviewers must approve before a Release PR can be merged:
- The `*` CODEOWNERS pattern assigns API codeowners as reviewers
- The ruleset's `required_reviewers` field auto-requests the `release-management_reviewers` team

              "type": "Team"
            }

        ],
        "require_code_owner_review": true,

      "actor_type": "Integration",

    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:
- `actor_id: 2865881` is the `camara-release-automation` GitHub App ID
- `reviewer.id: 13109132` is the `release-management_reviewers` team ID
- The `required_reviewers` field is a beta feature in the GitHub Rulesets API
- The canonical ruleset is maintained in `Template_API_Repository` — the JSON above matches it

</details>

### Applying the ruleset programmatically

The GitHub Rulesets API is **not idempotent** — calling `POST` twice creates duplicate rulesets. The admin script in `project-administration` uses a check-then-create/update pattern:

```bash
# List existing rulesets
existing=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets --jq '.[].name')

# Check if it exists, then create or update
if echo "$existing" | grep -q "release-snapshot-protection"; then
  id=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets --jq '.[] | select(.name == "release-snapshot-protection") | .id')
  gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/$id --input payload.json
else
  gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets --input payload.json
fi
```

See `project-administration/scripts/apply-release-rulesets.sh` for the full script.

## CODEOWNERS Requirements

### Standard CAMARA format

The release automation expects the standard CODEOWNERS format used across CAMARA repositories:

```
# Default owners for the whole repository
* @codeowner1 @codeowner2 @codeowner3

# Admin-managed files
/CODEOWNERS @camaraproject/admins
/MAINTAINERS.MD @camaraproject/admins
```

### CODEOWNERS and RM reviewer assignment

Legacy CAMARA repositories have `/CHANGELOG.md` and `/CHANGELOG.MD` lines in CODEOWNERS that assign `@camaraproject/release-management_reviewers` as reviewers for changelog files. The onboarding campaign **removes** these lines because:

- RM reviewer assignment for Release PRs is now enforced via the ruleset's `required_reviewers` field, which auto-requests the team and blocks merge until they approve
- Removing the CODEOWNERS lines means post-release sync PRs on `main` do **not** require RM reviewer approval (desirable — these are automated backports of already-approved release content)
- The `*` CODEOWNERS pattern ensures API codeowners still review all files

### How CODEOWNERS is used by the automation

The `/publish-release` command checks CODEOWNERS to authorize the publishing user:

1. Reads the `CODEOWNERS` file from the `main` branch
2. Finds the first line matching the `*` pattern and extracts all `@username` mentions
3. Compares the command user against the extracted list

**Authorization tiers:**
- `admin` / `maintain` permission: bypass CODEOWNERS check (break-glass)
- `write` permission: must be listed in CODEOWNERS `*` line
- `read` / no permission: rejected

**Notes:**
- GitHub's CODEOWNERS uses "last matching pattern wins" for reviewer assignment. The automation's publish authorization currently takes the first `*` line. In standard CAMARA repositories there is only one `*` line, so this is equivalent. Repositories should not have multiple `*` lines.
- Team references (e.g., `@camaraproject/team`) on the `*` line are extracted but do not match individual usernames — use individual `@username` entries on the `*` line
- If the CODEOWNERS file does not exist (404), the check is skipped and only repository permission is verified

---

## Caller Workflow

The caller workflow is the entry point that connects an API repository to the release automation. It is a static YAML file installed at `.github/workflows/release-automation.yml`.

### Source template

The canonical caller workflow template is maintained in the tooling repository:

```
camaraproject/tooling (release-automation branch)
  └── release_automation/workflows/release-automation-caller.yml
```

The onboarding campaign reads this file and copies it to each target repository. Do not maintain separate copies — the template in `tooling` is the single source of truth.

### Reference lifecycle

The caller's `uses:` line references the reusable workflow in `camaraproject/tooling`. The reference changes as the automation progresses through rollout phases:

| Phase | `uses:` ref | Who uses it |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Alpha | `@release-automation` | Test repositories |
| RC | `@ra-v1-rc` | Test + volunteering repos |
| GA | `@v1` | All API repositories |

See [branching-model.md](branching-model.md) for the full lifecycle and tag strategy.

When transitioning between phases, a campaign updates the `uses:` line across all participating repositories.

### Key configuration in the caller

| Aspect | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Permissions** | `contents: write`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write` | Branch/release ops, issue management, PR creation |
| **Concurrency** | `release-automation-${{ github.repository }}`, `cancel-in-progress: false` | Serialize runs, prevent race conditions |
| **Triggers** | `issue_comment`, `issues`, `pull_request`, `push`, `workflow_dispatch` | Slash commands, lifecycle events, auto-sync, manual |

---

## Required Files

### release-plan.yaml

Must exist on the `main` branch with valid content. This file drives the release automation — it defines what release to prepare and which APIs to include.

Minimum required fields:

```yaml
repository:
  target_release_tag: r1.1
  target_release_type: pre-release-rc  # or: pre-release-alpha, public-release, none
  release_track: Spring26              # meta-release name
  meta_release: Spring26

apis:
  - api_name: quality-on-demand
    api_version: 0.11.0

dependencies:
  commonalities: "0.5"                 # Commonalities version
  identity-and-consent-management: "0.3"  # ICM version (if applicable)
```

Valid `target_release_type` values: `pre-release-alpha`, `pre-release-rc`, `public-release`, `maintenance-release`, `none`

Setting `target_release_type: none` signals no active release — the automation sets the Release Issue state to `not-planned`.

The `release-plan.yaml` file is distributed by the `campaign-release-plan-rollout` campaign in `project-administration`. See the [release-plan schema](../../validation/schemas/release-plan-schema.yaml) for the complete specification.

### README.md delimiters

The README must contain release information section delimiters:

```markdown
<!-- CAMARA:RELEASE-INFO:START -->
## Release Information
...
<!-- CAMARA:RELEASE-INFO:END -->
```

These delimiters are used by the release automation to update the Release Information section during snapshot creation and post-release sync. If missing, the README update step will fail.

The delimiters are distributed by the `campaign-release-info` campaign in `project-administration`.

---

## CHANGELOG Structure

The release automation uses a per-cycle directory structure for changelog files:

```
CHANGELOG/
  CHANGELOG-r1.md   # All releases in cycle 1 (r1.1, r1.2, ...)
  CHANGELOG-r2.md   # All releases in cycle 2 (r2.1, r2.2, ...)
  README.md          # Index pointing to available files and legacy CHANGELOG.md
```

Each `/create-snapshot` command generates a release section in the appropriate per-cycle file. Multiple releases within the same cycle (e.g., r4.1 alpha, r4.1 RC, r4.2) accumulate in the same file with newest entries at the top.

### Migration from root CHANGELOG.md

Existing CAMARA repositories have a `CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root containing historical release notes. The migration to the new directory structure happens in two phases:

**Phase 1 — Onboarding (non-breaking)**

The onboarding campaign adds preparatory files without modifying existing content:

1. Add a forward-reference note at the top of the existing root `CHANGELOG.md`:
   ```markdown
   > Starting with release automation, new release changelogs are maintained
   > in the [CHANGELOG/](CHANGELOG/) directory with per-cycle files.
   ```

2. Create `CHANGELOG/README.md` as an index:
   ```markdown
   # Changelog

   Release changelogs are organized by release cycle.

   For historical release notes predating the automated release process,
   see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) in the repository root.
   ```

**Phase 2 — Content migration (separate, later)**

A follow-up campaign moves the legacy content from root `CHANGELOG.md` into the `CHANGELOG/` directory. The root file is reduced to a pointer. Details of the content migration (single archive file vs. split into per-cycle files) are decided at that time.

**Link safety**: Tag-specific links (e.g., `github.com/.../blob/r1.2/CHANGELOG.md`) are unaffected — tags are immutable snapshots of the repository at that point in time. The root placeholder preserves links to `CHANGELOG.md` on the default branch.

---

## Recommended Enhancements

### Configuration drift protection

When a release snapshot is active, changes to `release-plan.yaml` on `main` can cause the snapshot to diverge from the current configuration. The release automation includes a post-merge warning (config drift warning posted to the Release Issue), but does not block the PR.

For stronger protection, the `pr_validation` workflow can be extended to block PRs that modify `release-plan.yaml` when a `release-snapshot/*` branch exists. This is tracked as [camaraproject/tooling#63](https://github.com/camaraproject/tooling/issues/63) and can be implemented independently on the `main` branch (pr_validation v0).
